# git-test
## This file is simply a readme

the point of this repository is just to get known with git.

## Lets do this!

will I remember this?

git clone gets stuff from github to your computer!

I dont think so:

firstly, you make changes in the code

save, god damn it!

you can see what's new with git status

then you gotta git add them (remember to specify "." or what you want to add, the computer is stupid and cannnot understand that lack of input, is imput)

gooD!

git commit now! remmember to -m "with the reason or main chnages for that commit"

good!, git push it now!
