# git-test
## This file is simply a readme

the point of this repository is just to get known with git.

## Lets do this!

will I remember this?
I dont think so:
firstly, you make changes in the code
save, god damn it!
then you gotta git add them
gooD!
git commit now! remmember to -m "with the reason or main chnages for that commit"
good!, git pushi it now!
